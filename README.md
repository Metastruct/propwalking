# Propwalking
Propwalking, also known as Surface, is a Sandbox addon created by Willox that allows players to stand on props whilst they move. This allows for an amazingly fluid gameplay experience, but the addon is in a somewhat beta state causing some actions to be buggy, especially in multiplayer.
